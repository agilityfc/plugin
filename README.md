# Agility FC

A multi-purpose utility plugin for Agility FC members.

## Donation Service

The donation service is intended to lessen the burden of collecting and logging donations for AFC moderators.

Once the plugin is configured with the service's location and authentication token, donation data can be sent to it via the plugin's panel in the RuneLite sidebar.
Donation data is never sent automatically and instead requires explicit action from the user.
The data consists of:

- The name of the donor.
- The name of the receiver.
- The amount donated, in GP.
- The screenshot of the trade, loot key or price check screen.
